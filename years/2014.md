# 2014 - Cows

* [Specs](https://github.com/bovard/battlecode-server-2015/blob/2014-1.3.3/specs.md)


You start with an HQ who can build cowboys. Obviously they need to milk cows and shoot one another!

Java Version: 1.6?

### Gameplay
The 2014 Battlecode game was based around cow herding. The object of the game was to get 10 million milk before the other team. You got milk by building soldiers at your HQ, having your soldiers construct pastrs (pronounced “pastures,” short for Projected Animal Security and Treatment Region), and then herding cows into your pastrs. Each cow in a pastr would produce 1 milk per round. Cows were spontaneously generated on the map each round; some regions of the map generated cows faster than others. To herd cows into pastrs you could build noise towers, magical devices which could create noise at any location within a certain radius. Cows were scared away from noise, so you could use this noise to push cows into your pastrs. Building either a pastr or a noise tower required sacrificing a single soldier, which transformed into the desired building.
